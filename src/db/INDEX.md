Function Definition:

```
const connectDB = async () => {
```

This defines an asynchronous function named connectDB.

## try Block:

javascript

```
try {
```

The try block is used to attempt the database connection and handle any errors that might occur during the process.

## Connecting to MongoDB:

javascript

```
const connectionInstance = await mongoose.connect(
`${process.env.MONGODB_URL} /${DB_NAME}`
);
```

mongoose.connect(...) is a method provided by Mongoose to connect to a MongoDB database.
await is used to wait for the connection to complete since it returns a promise.
process.env.MONGODB_URL is an environment variable that contains the base URL for the MongoDB server.${DB_NAME} is a variable representing the name of the database to connect to.These two variables are combined to form the complete MongoDB connection string.

##Logging Connection Info:

```
console.log(
`\n mongodb connected to ${connectionInstance.connection.host}`
);
```

If the connection is successful, it logs a message indicating that the connection was established and shows the host to which it connected.

Catch Block:

```
} catch (e) {
console.error('connection error : ', e);
process.exit(1);
}
```

If there's an error during the connection attempt, the catch block handles it.
console.error('connection error : ', e); logs the error message.
process.exit(1); terminates the process with an error code 1 to indicate that something went wrong.

Exporting the Function:

export default connectDB;

```
This line exports the connectDB function so it can be imported and used in other parts of the application.

```
